"""What is Amazon Kendra?""","Amazon Kendra is a highly accurate and easy to use enterprise search service that’s powered by machine learning. Kendra enables developers to add search capabilities to their applications so their end users can discover information stored within the vast amount of content spread across their company. This includes data from manuals, research reports, FAQs, HR documentation, customer service guides, and is found across various systems such as file systems, web sites, Box, DropBox, Salesforce, SharePoint, relational databases, Amazon S3, and more. When you type a question, the service uses machine learning algorithms to understand the context and return the most relevant results, whether that be a precise answer or an entire document. For example, you can ask a question like 'How much is the cash reward on the corporate credit card?' and Kendra will map to the relevant documents and return a specific answer like '2%'. Kendra provides sample code so that you can get started quickly and easily integrate highly accurate search into your new or existing applications."
"""How does Amazon Kendra work with other AWS services?""","Amazon Kendra provides ML-powered search capabilities for all unstructured data customers store in AWS. Kendra offers easy integration with popular repository types such as file systems, web sites, Box, DropBox, Salesforce, SharePoint, relational databases, Amazon S3 so that you can index your content with a few clicks, and search your information without writing a single line of code."
"""What types of questions can I ask Amazon Kendra?""","""Amazon Kendra supports the following common types of questions: 
1. Factoid questions (who, what, when, where): 'Who is Amazon’s CEO?' or 'When is Prime Day 2019?'. These require fact-based answers that may be returned in the form of a single word or phrase. The precise answer, however, must be explicitly stated in the ingested text content. 
2. Descriptive questions: 'How do I connect my Echo Plus to my network?' or 'How do I obtain tax benefits for lower income families?' where the answer could be a sentence, passage, or an entire document.
3. Keyword searches: 'Fitbit waterproof' or 'Honda warranty', where the intent and scope are not very clear. Kendra will leverage its deep learning models to return relevant documents in these cases."""
"""What if my data does not contain the precise answer Amazon Kendra is looking for?""","""When your data does not contain a precise answer to a question, Kendra returns a list of the most relevant documents ranked by its deep learning models."""
"""What types of questions will Amazon Kendra be unable to answer?""","""Kendra does not yet support questions for which the answers require cross-document passage aggregation or calculations."""
"""How do developers get up and running with Amazon Kendra?""","""The Kendra console provides the easiest way to get started. You can point Kendra at unstructured and semi-structured documents like FAQs stored in S3. After ingestion, you can start testing Kendra by typing queries directly in the 'search' section of the console. You can then deploy Kendra search in your own application with a few lines of code, or by copying short code samples from the reference implementations to replicate specific functionality."""
"""Can I customize Amazon Kendra to better fit my company’s domain or business specialty?""","""Kendra offers domain specific expertise for IT, pharma, insurance, oil and gas, industrial, financial services, legal, media and entertainment, travel and hospitality, health, human resources, news, telecommunications, mining, food and beverage, and automotive.

"""In what regions is Amazon Kendra available?""","""Kendra is currently available in the following AWS regions: Northern Virginia, Oregon, and Ireland. See the AWS Region Table for more details."""
"""Does Amazon Kendra learn and improve search results over time?""","""Amazon Kendra's machine learning models are regularly retrained and tuned for each customer by analyzing and incorporating end-user search patterns and feedback. Improvements to a customer’s models are not shared with other customers."""
"""How does Amazon Kendra improve its machine learning models?""","""In order to provide a continuously improving search experience, Amazon Kendra captures the activities during searches (clicks, thumbs up or down) and will surface metrics and insights to you so that you can make improvements. Amazon Kendra's machine learning models are regularly retrained and tuned for each customer by capturing end-user search patterns and feedback. For example, when users search for 'How do I change my health benefits?', multiple HR and benefit documents will compete for a top spot. Although more recent documents can be ranked higher in the list, this criterion alone might not be sufficient to win the top spot on the list. However, as interest grows for the latest year’s enrollment instructions and users start opening it more than the older ones, the Kendra model will learn to increasingly prioritize the new document towards the top of the list. Improvements to a customer’s models are not shared with other customers."""

"""Can Amazon Kendra filter on user context?""","""Amazon Kendra enables you to filter a query response to remove documents from the result based on a user name and group membership. User context filtering depends on two things:
1) Setting attributes on the indexed documents.
2) Including user and group information when querying the index.

Use user context to filter documents based on user and group membership. If no user and group information is included in the query, Amazon Kendra returns all documents. You can add a user or a group to either an allow list or a deny list for the document. If a user or group is added to the deny list, the document is filtered out of any query that contains the user or group. You specify the user and group information when you query the index using the built-in attributes ""_user_id"" and ""_group_ids"". You can set up to 100 group identifiers.

Amazon Kendra does not match users to groups. When you use user-context filtering, you must include all of the groups that a user belongs to when you make the query. For example, if a user belongs to two groups, ""HR"" and ""IT,"" you must include both groups in the request.

The following example shows a request that filters the query response based on the user ID and groups. The query will return any document that has the user or the ""HR"" or ""IT"" groups in the allow list. If the user or either group is in the deny list for a document, the document will not be returned.

response = kendra.query(
    QueryText = query,
    IndexId = index,
    AttributeFilter = {
        ""OrAllFilters"": [
            {

                }
            }
        ]
    }
    )
User context filtering isn't an authentication or authorization control for your content. It doesn't do user authentication on the user and groups sent to the Query operation. It is up to your application to ensure that the user and group information sent to Query operation is authenticated and authorized. There is an implementation of user context filtering for each data source. For more information please see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/user-context-filter.html. """
